24-time USA Today bestseller Sarina Bowen&amp;#039;s first holiday collection! Enjoy three complete holiday romances from Sarina Bowen. You&amp;#039;re getting: Boyfriend: a complete holiday novel with a hilarious premise. Rent a boyfriend for the holiday. For $25, I will be your Thanksgiving date. I will show up in a nice shirt, talk hockey with your dad and bring your mother flowers... Everyone knows it&amp;#039;s a bad idea to introduce your hockey crush to your messed-up family. But Abbi really needs a date for Thanksgiving, even if she can&amp;#039;t say why. But when she tears Weston&amp;#039;s number off of a flyer, she accidentally entangles Moo U&amp;#039;s star defenseman in a ruse that neither of them can easily unwind. Crossroads: a novella of missed connections, broken dreams and two hearts that just won&amp;#039;t quit. Damien Rossi drives a taxi but dreams of more. Specifically, he dreams about Nicolette Overland, his favorite client, a lonely beauty who lives in an actual mansion on a hill. Nicolette can&amp;#039;t stop thinking about the hunky guy with the soulful brown eyes, either. She looks forward to every Christmas holiday when she knows he&amp;#039;ll be waiting for her at the airport. But when she screws up her courage to finally tell him how she feels, it might be too late... Blonde Date: a novella of hot nerds, basketball and revenge. Katie is done with bad boys after some very poor treatment by a fraternity guy. Now, facing a holiday Greek event, she needs a date. A nice guy this time. Good thing a certain nerdy basketball player wants to audition for the role. Note: Boyfriend (68k words) is separately available, Crossroads (35k words) is brand new, and Blonde Date (30k words) has been previously published.
