Jessica Martin is not a nice girl. As Prom Queen and Captain of the cheer squad, she&amp;#039;d ruled her school mercilessly, looking down her nose at everyone she deemed unworthy. The most unworthy of them all? The &amp;quot;freak,&amp;quot; Manson Reed: her favorite victim. But a lot changes after high school. A freak like him never should have ended up at the same Halloween party as her. He never should have been able to beat her at a game of Drink or Dare. He never should have been able to humiliate her in front of everyone. Losing the game means taking the dare: a dare to serve Manson for the entire night as his slave. It&amp;#039;s a dare that Jessica&amp;#039;s pride - and curiosity - won&amp;#039;t allow her to refuse. What ensues is a dark game of pleasure and pain, fear and desire. Is it only a game? Only revenge? Only a dare? Or is it something more? The Dare is an 18+ erotic romance novella and a prequel to the Losers Duet. Reader discretion is strongly advised. This book contains graphic sexual scenes, intense scenes of BDSM, and strong language. A full content note can be found in the front matter of the book.
