Overview
Wine can be daunting without an incisive guide. Who’s Afraid of Romanée-Conti? is a no-holds-barred voyage of discovery, from sourcing good cheap vino to drinking its most unattainable and holiest of grails – Romanée-Conti – and the universe of interstellar wines that lie in-between.
 
 From new-school Burgundy, Barolo and Champagne to Tenerife, Corsica and Chianti, Noble Rot co-founder Dan Keeling visits some of the world’s most renowned vignerons and vineyards on a quest to find out why some wines matter – and why many others don’t. Throughout, he details the complex aspects of traditionalist wine culture, offering insights into subjects such as sulphur in winemaking, building a cellar, and many personal recommendations on what to buy for every pocket.
 
 It’s wine – but not as you know it.
 
 “I love this book. There’s pleasure on every page. It’s essential reading for wine lovers and wine novices.” – Keira Knightley
 
 “Who’s Afraid of Romanée-Conti? makes discovering great wine as exciting as the NME made discovering great music back in the day.” – Mike Diamond, The Beastie Boys
 
 “In the world of fine wine and fine eats, Keeling’s palate rules. Above all, this Englishman is a literate man of taste, passion, and talent. Bon appétit!” Kermit Lynch, author of Adventures on the Wine Route.
 
 “This book is bloody amazing! ... Empowering, energising and without a scintilla of snobbery, this set off little explosions of excitement in me. It&#039;s your passport to pleasure.” Diana Henry
 
 “Every word and thought here is shot through with verve, wit and often piercing snark. I dare you not to be engaged by the wisdom and writing of Dan Keeling. Do you need this collection of attitude-changing essays? If you care about wine (or want to) you absolutely do.” Alice Feiring, author of To Fall in Love, Drink This.
 
 “No-one writes about wine like Dan Keeling. Who&#039;s Afraid is totally absorbing and just as importantly fun. Love it.” – Angela Hartnett
